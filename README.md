## Stable Diffusion Model for Text to Image and Image to Image Conversion

### Introduction
The stable diffusion model is a powerful framework for generating high-quality images from text descriptions or transforming existing images into new ones. It leverages a combination of techniques including attention mechanisms, deep generative models, and the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model to achieve impressive results.

### Files Overview
1. **add_noise.ipynb**: This notebook  contains code for adding noise to images, which is a crucial step in the diffusion process to generate diverse samples.
   
2. **attention.py**: This file implements attention mechanisms, which are essential for capturing long-range dependencies and improving the quality of generated images by focusing on relevant parts of the input.

3. **clip.py**: CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) is a neural network that learns to understand text and images by contrasting them in a joint embedding space. This module provides functions to integrate CLIP into the diffusion model for conditioning.

4. **ddpm.py**: DDPM (Diffusion Probabilistic Models) is a type of generative model used in the diffusion process. It models the conditional distribution of pixels given the noise process, allowing for efficient generation of high-fidelity images.

5. **decoder.py**: The decoder module is responsible for generating images from latent representations produced by the diffusion model. It transforms the noise process into realistic images based on the learned distribution.

6. **demo.ipynb**: This notebook  contains a demonstration of the text-to-image or image-to-image conversion process using the stable diffusion model. It may include example code and visualizations to showcase the model's capabilities.

7. **diffusion.py**: This file  contains the core implementation of the diffusion model, including functions for sampling from the diffusion process, calculating log-likelihoods, and training the model.

8. **encoder.py**: The encoder module encodes images into latent representations, which can then be used by the decoder to generate reconstructions or transformations. It may utilize convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or other feature extractors.

9. **model_converter.py**: This script provides utilities for converting models between different formats or frameworks, facilitating interoperability and deployment in various environments.

10. **model_loader.py**: The model loader module handles loading pre-trained models and initializing them for inference or fine-tuning. It ensures consistency and reproducibility across different experiments or deployments.

11. **pipeline.py**: The pipeline module orchestrates the entire text-to-image or image-to-image conversion process, from input preprocessing to output generation. It may include functions for data loading, conditioning, sampling, and evaluation.
